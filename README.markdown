# Rails Templates

This is my store of Rails 3 templates. Feel free to fork, fix and adapt to suit your own needs.

## How to Use
In your workspace, clone the repo:
    git clone git://github.com/mconnell/rails_templates.git

Then run the Rails installer (excluding prototype and test unit)
    rails app_name -JT -m 'rails_templates/typical.rb'

Tada!
